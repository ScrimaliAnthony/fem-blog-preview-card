# Frontend Mentor - Blog preview card solution

This is my solution to the **Blog Preview Card** challenge on [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/blog-preview-card-ckPaj01IcS).

## 🌟 Goal

I created this project for two main reasons:

1. **Back to basics** – I usually work with modern frameworks (like React), but here I wanted to go back to pure HTML and CSS. It was a good opportunity to simplify and refocus on core web fundamentals.
2. **Getting familiar with Frontend Mentor** – This simple project helped me get used to how the platform works, from starting a challenge to submitting a solution.
